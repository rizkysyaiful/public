# Codex Vitae

## How to play

1. **Every day:** In the morning, read Review Every Day
2. **Every month:** On the 1st of every month, read Review Every Month
3. **Every year:** On your birthday, read Review Every Year

## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. Basically attempts to set a part of my brain to always be on the lookout for specific things that I want to be sure to catch. Use my subconscious to my advantage. 

1. **Steer toward quality time:** Look for opportunities to enjoy quality time with myself, other people, and my interests.
2. **Notice anomalies:** Notice when something is unresolved, unwanted, or in conflict with my beliefs -- resist the urge to move these anomalies into blind spots.
3. **Notice the voices:** Many of my beliefs about myself and the world are really just automated voices passing off beliefs that have been hard-coded in my head over time as indisputable facts. I shouldn't assume they're always right.
4. **Remember the soloverse:** What I think is the universe is actually my mental model of the universe (the soloverse). Don't forget.

## Review Every Month

## Favorite Ideas
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression and capturing the meaning that we create in our lives.

### Quality Time

My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. I see 3 kinds of quality time that we should seek out. The first is quality time with our own selves. Know thyself, and in the process find our deep interests and find people that we can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those interests, and the third is quality time with those people we can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other: you can't really connect deeply with others until you know yourself sufficiently well; often times interests are strengthened by having people you can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with yourself, your interests, and others and you will not regret anything on your death bed.

### Optionality

Or, as Nassim Nicolas Taleb calls it: [antifragility](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/). I like the word optionality because it seems more neutral, almost boring even, and yet it is probably one of the most simple and powerful ideas that I’ve ever encountered. The easiest way to describe it is the degree to which your eggs are in different baskets. 

The more baskets, and the more eggs, and the more evenly distributed those eggs are in those baskets, the greater your chances that any single event won't wipe you out of eggs entirely, and the greater your chances that one of those eggs is going to be amazing. The beauty of optionality is that it has both protective and self-strengthening qualities. Sticking with the metaphor, say that you have 12 eggs in 1 basket. If something happens to that basket, all of your eggs are doomed (low optionality). On the other hand, say that you have 12 eggs in 6 baskets (2 in each). If something happens to one of the baskets, you still have 10 eggs (higher optionality). Now imagine that you have 12 eggs in 12 baskets, all of the eggs are different colors, and there are monsters that prefer certain colors of eggs for breakfast. As the monsters wake up every morning and have breakfast, the type of eggs that they like will become more rare. There will be more remaining eggs with colors that they don’t like. In a way, the remaining set of eggs has become stronger (less likely to be eaten) than the set was previously. This is how high optionality works. The final twist is that in order for this to really work, it has to have some level of randomness involved… because what if the monster also adapts over time and begins to prefer new colors of eggs? In order for the eggs to be safe from complete elimination, there should be enough variation in the colors that some eggs won’t get eaten, and those eggs will need to hatch and grow and the population of future eggs will represent eggs that are less appetizing to monster. Optionality is the key to natural selection and evolution. It’s also the key to idea generation, investment strategy, product management, and many other things. 

In practice it seems counter-intuitive to build systems with high optionality. We tend to build systems that converge on a single design over time (see monocultures) because they are predictable and efficient in a given environment. But environments change, and without the ability to predict how those changes will happen ahead of time, optionality is required even in the safest of environments.

### Soloverse

**Soloverse:** This is my word for an idea I'm obsessed with. It goes something like this: the universe is this giant space/time environment that we are all a part of. The *soloverse* is our mental model of that universe that our brain uses to *think about* the universe and everything in it. It turns out, we can’t really think about the universe directly (it’s way too big), we can only think about our mental model of the universe as it exists in our soloverse. Lots of interesting (to me) side effects result from this distinction.

I first came across this idea last year and found some interesting explorations of the idea referenced by the word *umwelt*, which is German for “environment” or “surroundings” and pronounced *oom-velt*. I just made up the term soloverse because it’s easier for me to think of it as a private universe in our minds.

A few thoughts about soloverses:

1. *The soloverse is our local cache of the universe.* When we’re babies, our caches are not very full, and we're forced to take in the full firehose of the universe… unsorted, uncategorized, raw. It’s overwhelming. Our brains are designed to start building this soloverse almost immediately in order to gain some foothold on the raw craziness of all the information coming in. The soloverse is built up from basic building blocks like light and dark, smells, sounds, and eventually patterns (mom, hungry, cold, soft), and then eventually concepts (blanket, food) and meanings (safe, scared, good, bad).
2. *What we think of as the universe is actually our soloverse.* From these basic building blocks we create beliefs and build simulations that allow us to predict future occurrences (if I cry, mom will come to me). At some point we arrive at a concept of our own selves and other people. “The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.” — [Kevin Smokler](http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process)
3. *The soloverse contains gods and archetypes and the self.* Some of our most powerful beliefs and traditional characters (God, the hero, the devil, the wizard, the fairy godmother, even our concept of our self) all exist only in our soloverses. Unicorns, dragons, Santa, astrology, luck, fairness, truth, good and evil, beginning middle and end, physics, etc are all shadows of the structure that our soloverse is running on (our brains, and the pattern matching hierarchies that they are built from) and most likely absent from the universe that they are attempting to model. This quirk is actually really fascinating to explore.
4. *The soloverse is the most powerful tool we have.* The model of the universe that we each have is highly personal, and idiosyncratic to the experiences we’ve had. There are also large portions of which there is probably lots of overlap (common sense, myths, popular culture, things we learn in school, etc). An unhealthy soloverse will lead to poor/misinformed decision-making. An unhealthy soloverse could be responsible for cruelty, prejudice, hatred, wars, and all kinds of other unfortunate things. What could we do to help ourselves and each other have healthier soloverses? Could we address this issue directly and have an impact?
5. *A comprehensively complete soloverse must also model every other soloverse that exists.* In order to build a real “to scale” model of the universe it has to also include every other soloverse out there, including itself. We can’t escape our personal soloverse, but we can make it a more hospitable place to live in the meantime.

### Quantum realism

Quantum realism is a term I first learned from [an article](http://listverse.com/2014/11/26/10-reasons-why-our-universe-is-a-virtual-reality/) by Brian Whitmore, a senior lecturer in computing at Massey University. The idea is in opposition to "physical realism" (that belief that the physical world we see is real and exists by itself, alone). Quantum realism asserts that the physical world isn't real in itself, but merely the output (or shadow, or result, or projected image) of a quantum reality that is generating it. It's basically a virtual reality, or a simulation.

I'm still learning about this and definitely couldn't explain or defend it, but I'm fascinated by the idea and keep thinking about it.

### On Privacy
1. Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected

4. Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

### On Logic
1. Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
2. Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

### On Education
1. Something will replace universities (as we currently know them) as the majority path towards advanced education by 2030
2. Playing lots of games (of any kind: video, board, card, other) in your youth will make you smarter than people who don't 

### On Politics & The Economy
1. It should be easier and more expedient to put neglectful and irresponsible public servants in prison than the average citizen, not slower and more difficult
2. Most jobs lost between 2008-2012 aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)
3. In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live (see disability trends as proxy for this)

2. Love at first sight happens

### Meta
1. We have very little control over what we believe in
2. Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
3. I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
4. Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)

### Wagers
1. With Carinna. By 2028, the equivalent of a college education (both in breadth of knowledge and value to career) will be available to anyone with an internet connection.
2. With Rick Webb. By March 1st, 2016, descendants of Google Glass will be seen regularly in the wild (in the same way that Fitbits, NikeFuel bands, and retina MacBook Pros are in 2013).

# Monthly Reports

##### Desember 2014:
*Summary:*
Pertengahan pertama Desember diisi dengan mencoba 

*Quality time:*
* 19th : Pertama kali naik gunung. Langsung menagih kecantikan-kecantikan gunung. Teman yang baru akrab jadi jauh lebih akrab. :D
* 28th-29th : Mengobrol panjang dengan mama. Membahas tingkah saya yang tidak menyenangkan saat pulang. Saya dan mama memang sering mengobrol dalam kala kita sedang jatuh. Sekarang giliran saya yang jatuh, dan mama yang mengingatkan untuk mengatur ekspektasi hidup dengan lebih baik (Zen) dan menghargai perbedaan-perbedaan antar manusia. Dari mama pula saya tahu apa yang papa pikirkan demi kebaikan saya. Saya bahagia sekali punya orang tua seperti mereka. :'-)

*Chaos monkeys:*
* Berhenti kerja setelah sepakat berbeda arah dengan bos terkait 'anak perusahaan' yang akan dirintis. Bukti bahwa sulit ada dua Product Owner dalam bisnis, khususnya yang masih embrionik.
* Proses melamar pekerjaan ke sebuah komunitas Agile yang berpusat di Eropa. Hampir masuk jika tidak terlalu jujur. Namun tidak menyesal karena sudah jujur. :D
* Di tengah akhir Desember saat bantu statup teman (X-Igent) sempat burn-out karena terlalu lelah.
* Di akhir Desember ingin jualan paket pendampingan EELcommunity.com, tapi ternyata kurang laku. Diduga sulit laku karena tawarannya terlalu baru buat orang awam. Setelah mengobrol coach lain (Arry & Zara) sepakat jualan bukunya dulu. Tidak lakunya dan jadi proses persiapan jualan buku ini juga memperparah burn-out.
* Sedikit drama saat pulang ke rumah di penghujung Desember. Burn-out jelas-jelas mempengaruhi emosi hubungan-hubungan kita.

*Outcome of previous goal:*
Previous goal? Survive. :P Tapi ada deh gol yang khas dari bulan ini. Karena bulan ini berhenti kerja sehingga harus mengembalikan laptop kantor. Setelah sibuk sana sibuk sini, akhirnya sukses juga beli laptop di pertengahan Desember. 

*New goals:*
* Konsisten dengan Codex Vitae: Bulan lalu tahu Codex Vitae. Memutuskan untuk menulis di tahun 2015. 
* AgileCampus.org goes MVP (minimum viable product): Terbukti dengan bisa membuka training publik.
* Testimoo.com goes MVP: Utamanya agar bisa menggunakannya sebagai pendongkrak jualan training & lobi-lobi AgileCampus.org. Juga konsisten dengan branding pribadi yang ingin diangkat.
* Wajib tidur minimal 8 jam setiap harinya. No more burn-out.
* (sudah, ini dulu. jangan banyak-banyak)

### 2014: ++----+----+

##### January 2015:

*Quality Time:*
* pre-1st: New Year Eve! Salah satu malam tahun baru terbaik dalam hidup sejauh ini. Indah sekali melihat kembang api dari gedung tertinggi di daerah Bandung Barat. Seru juga karena sembari menggila berisik-berisik bersama teman-teman baru di tempat kerja sekarang. Salah satunya sampai membuat tulisan blog tentang ini. http://yurichobilly.blogspot.com/2014/12/gua-vs-tahun-baru-2015.html 
* 1st: Kegilaan berlanjut dengan obrolan-obrolan bersama teman-teman baru di Indigo Incubator 2014 ini. Dari siang sampai magrib kita mengobrol masalah mendekati wanita, seks, dan cinta.
* 2nd: Tidur cepat tanggal 1 membuat saya terbagun tengah malam. Ini saya gunakan untuk menulis Codex Vitae.
